# Project: Star Wars detection adventure

In this project, I work on the dataset **star wars survey** which was collected by the team at FiveThirtyEight before the release of *Star Wars: The Force Awakens* to answer their question:*Does the rest of America realize that “The Empire Strikes Back” is clearly the best of the bunch?*

The data is collected by running a poll through [SurveyMonkey Audience](https://www.surveymonkey.com/welcome/market-research-services/?program=7013A000000mv4DQAQ&utm_bu=AD&utm_campaign=71700000060577971&utm_adgroup=58700005468446087&utm_content=43700049906461874&utm_medium=cpc&utm_source=adwords&utm_term=p49906461874&utm_kxconfid=s4bvpi0ju&gclid=Cj0KCQjwvO2IBhCzARIsALw3ASo35knlfgJa39M7CqHJQ0YDsgjzoZm-lW3vaXT-l2anA9KrXb-dnSwaAqw_EALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds) , surveying 1,186 respondents from June 3 to 6 in 2014. I will clean this data and use it to answer some questions like: Is Star Wars really popular as I thought? Which gender prefers to watch it? Which episode is a real breadwinner? Who is the most impressive character and who is the most favorite? Identify the pattern of Star Wars customers and so on.

## Summary of results

After interpretations, these are some of my observations:

Star Wars audiences are about 3 times more than who is not. Men shows more interest in Star Wars than women but both genders like Episode V The Empire Strikes Back most. The audience of Star Wars are of the age of 30-60, so they have graduated from high school, with the household income between $ 50,000 - $ 99,999.The 3 biggest markets of Star Wars include Pacific, East North Central and South Atlantic. About the character:Luke Skywalker is the most impressive but Han Solo is the most favorite.
